    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I developed this recipe when I had an abundance of zucchini and wanted a
      muffin to have with a chicken dinner. These savory muffins are great as a
      quick breakfast too! They're a hit even with those who think they don't
      like zucchini!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded unpeeled zucchini</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>¾ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>¼ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>4 slices bacon, cooked crisp and crumbled</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 12 muffin cups with
        cooking spray.
      </p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl.</p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>
        In another bowl, stir together the butter, egg, milk, zucchini, and
        garlic until well blended. Mix the flour mixture into the milk mixture,
        about 1/2 cup at a time, stirring between additions, until the flour
        mixture is incorporated. Fold in the Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese,
        and crumbled bacon, and pour the batter into the prepared muffin cups.
      </p>
      <li>Step</li>
      <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of
        a muffin comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Allow muffins to cool
        slightly before removing from muffin cups; serve warm. Refrigerate
        leftovers.
